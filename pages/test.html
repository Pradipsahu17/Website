Everyone wants to get out from the internet to able to spend some time with families, friends, and relatives with their moments. But most the of people are addicted to the internet. And it’s losing the connection and bond of having a family, friends, and relatives. The Internet is also helping the politicians to infect the society by dividing the unity of people by producing communalism and casteism material on the internet. Producers of communalism and casteism in the society never develop the society. But they use it to get votes and favor of people in the election. There are so many inappropriate materials on social media sites and internet. Such materials are not good for children, teenagers. There are so many hacking information and data on the internet.
