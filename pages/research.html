  <p>Paletton is an online application located on the internet at Paletton.com. It provides powerfull tool to create color combinations and palettes of colors that work together well. The major advantage of Paletton is it's not using the modern computer and engineering RGB color space, but it's built on a classical artistic color wheel, applies classical color theory and works within a specially created RYB color space. Therefore the color combinations it produces are very different from those you can get in many computer graphic applications.
